## About the program

The AI apprentice program is a six-month **intensive training experience** that bridges traditional software engineering with AI-driven development. This isn't just another coding bootcamp. It's about mastering intelligent systems and delivering AI solutions that solve real problems.

We designed this program for engineers who see the AI revolution happening and want to be part of shaping it.

The program is designed for people who:

- Have solid software engineering fundamentals and want to advance into the AI era
- Are already working in tech but need to level up their AI and agent development skills
- Want to master AI consulting and client delivery
- Come with curiosity about how AI transforms software development

Working with us provides cutting-edge experience where you will:

- Build production-ready AI applications with real client teams
- Master the consulting mindset while delivering AI solutions that create business value
- Learn to pair program with AI tools and integrate them into your workflow
- Develop skills to communicate complex AI concepts to non-technical stakeholders

## What you will learn & master

### Part 1: Consulting fundamentals

**Core consulting skills**

- Focus on objectives and measurable outcomes
- Master clear communication with technical and non-technical audiences
- Navigate client expectations and manage project scope
- Present complex AI concepts in accessible language

**Software engineering foundation**

- Understand project objectives and technical requirements
- Master the software development lifecycle in an AI context
- Apply version control (Git) and modern development environments
- Use collaborative tools that keep distributed teams aligned

### Part 2: Traditional apps vs. agent applications

**Traditional application architecture**

- Component-based design patterns and data flow
- State management and user interaction patterns

**Agent application architecture**

- Understanding autonomous agents and decision-making processes
- Prompt engineering and LLM integration patterns
- Managing uncertainty and designing for human-AI collaboration

### Part 3: Pair programming with AI

**LLM as development partner**

- Effective prompt engineering for code generation
- Using AI assistants for debugging and code review
- Understanding when to trust AI suggestions vs. human judgment

**Advanced AI integration**

- Working with embeddings and vector databases
- Implementing RAG systems and building custom AI tools
- Monitoring and improving AI system performance

### Part 4: Research and knowledge sharing

**Research and experimentation**

- Evaluate emerging AI tools and frameworks
- Design experiments to validate AI approaches

**Knowledge sharing**

- Document your learning journey and discoveries
- Present findings to technical and business audiences
- Contribute to the AI community through writing and speaking

## Program timeline

### Month 1: Foundation building

- Technical assessment and skill evaluation

- Final evaluation and capstone project

## Prerequisites

This program assumes you have:

- **Programming foundation**: Comfortable with at least one programming language and basic software development
- **Web development experience**: APIs, databases, and modern development workflows
- **Professional experience**: Background working in software teams or client-facing environments
- **Growth mindset**: Eagerness to learn rapidly and adapt to new technologies
- **Communication skills**: Ability to explain technical concepts clearly

We're looking for engineers ready to level up, not beginners learning programming from scratch.

## How to apply

**Program opens: Late 2025**

This program is intensive and selective. We're looking for engineers who:

- Have the technical foundation to hit the ground running
- Want to become leaders in the AI revolution
- Are excited about consulting and client delivery
- Can commit fully to six months of intensive learning

The AI landscape moves fast, and so do we. Applications will open in late 2025.
