## About the program

The AI apprentice program is a six-month **intensive training experience** that bridges traditional software engineering with the emerging world of AI-driven development. This isn't just another coding bootcamp. It's about mastering the craft of building intelligent systems and learning to deliver AI solutions that actually solve real problems.

We designed this program for engineers who see the AI revolution happening and want to be part of shaping it, not just watching from the sidelines.

The program is designed for people who:

- Have solid software engineering fundamentals and want to advance into the AI era
- Are already working in tech but need to level up their AI and agent development skills
- Want to master the art of AI consulting and client delivery
- Come with curiosity about how AI transforms traditional software development

Working with us provides cutting-edge experience where you will:

- Build production-ready AI applications and agent systems with real client teams
- Master the consulting mindset while delivering AI solutions that create genuine business value
- Learn to pair program with AI tools and integrate them into your development workflow
- Develop the soft skills needed to communicate complex AI concepts to non-technical stakeholders

## Program timeline

Here's what you'll experience during your intensive six months:

### Your first month: Foundation building

- **Technical assessment**: Evaluate your current skills and identify areas for growth
- **Group workshops**: Dive deep into AI fundamentals, consulting basics, and our development practices through weekly intensive sessions
- **Pairing with seniors**: Work directly with experienced AI engineers on live client projects
- **First checkpoint**: Review progress and adjust learning path based on your strengths

### Next three months: Client project immersion

- **Full team integration**: Join one of our AI consulting teams as a contributing member
- **Client interaction**: Participate in client meetings, requirements gathering, and solution presentation
- **Hands-on development**: Build real AI applications that solve actual business problems
- **Weekly mentoring**: One-on-one sessions focused on both technical skills and consulting capabilities
- **Mid-program review**: Comprehensive evaluation of your growth and areas for continued focus

### Final two months: Specialization and leadership

- **Choose your path**: Focus on your preferred AI specialization while continuing client work
- **Research project**: Investigate an emerging AI technology or methodology
- **Knowledge sharing**: Present your research findings to the team and broader community
- **Peer mentoring**: Support newer apprentices as they begin their journey
- **Final evaluation**: Demonstrate mastery through a capstone project and comprehensive review

## Prerequisites and expectations

This program assumes you already have:

- **Solid programming foundation**: Comfortable with at least one programming language and basic software development concepts
- **Understanding of web development**: Experience with APIs, databases, and modern development workflows
- **Professional experience**: Some background working in software teams or client-facing environments
- **Growth mindset**: Eagerness to learn rapidly and adapt to new technologies
- **Communication skills**: Ability to explain technical concepts clearly

We're looking for engineers who are ready to level up, not beginners who need to learn programming from scratch.

## How to apply

This program is intensive and selective. We're looking for engineers who:

- Have the technical foundation to hit the ground running
- Want to become leaders in the AI revolution
- Are excited about the consulting and client delivery aspects of AI work
- Can commit fully to six months of intensive learning and growth
