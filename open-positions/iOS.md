# Senior iOS Developer

## About us

Found in 2014, we are a team of geeks, hustles and startup veterans. We live around the world but most of us based in Saigon, Vietnam. We are (forever) young and always eager to learn. We have passion and experience in making cool products, esp. cloud and mobile apps. We want to help entrepreneurs solve real problems using our approachs and solutions.

We call ourselves dwarves, the small and misshapen creatures in Norse Mythology. We are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. We have Miners, Crafters, Wizards and Soliders.

We position ourselves as a Startups Factory. We build innovative products, give a hand to build companies and also give seed investment. Join our network if you are **startup veterans**, can wear multiple hats at the time and want to build multiple world class products.

We are driven by values, not just the money. We aim to the perfection as our standard. You can find more information about us here: https://github.com/dwarvesf/WeAreHiring

## How to be a dwarf?

We build innovative apps for startup. You have to prove that you own the platform or can/want to own the platform one day. You've built several applications and our initial assignments during the [interview process](https://github.com/dwarvesf/WeAreHiring#hiring-process) will be a walk in a park for you ;-)

Hopefully you'll have some published code (maybe on GitHub?) that we can take a look at.

Honestly, we don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, and so on. We want to see that you know the shit.
