# Senior Frontend Developer

## About us

Found in 2014, we are a team of geeks, hustles and startup veterans. We live around the world but most of us based in Saigon, Vietnam. We are (forever) young and always eager to learn. We have passion and experience in making cool products, esp. cloud and mobile apps. We want to help entrepreneurs solve real problems using our approachs and solutions.

We call ourselves dwarves, the small and misshapen creatures in Norse Mythology. We are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. We have Miners, Crafters, Wizards and Soliders.

We position ourselves as a Startups Factory. We build innovative products, give a hand to build companies and also give seed investment. Join our network if you are **startup veterans**, can wear multiple hats at the time and want to build multiple world class products.

We are driven by values, not just the money. We aim to the perfection as our standard. You can find more information about us here: https://github.com/dwarvesf/WeAreHiring

## Prerequisite

- Have the [**same DNA**](https://github.com/dwarvesf/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#our-core-values) which lead you to culture fit
- We do agile
- Real git user
- Mac or Linux
- OOP Design: from STUPID to SOLID
- Convention and architecture
- Want to make world class product. All the outcome must be world class.
- Watching trends and best practices in development.
- Reading blogs and compiling ideas how to improve your skills.
- Know how to handle the entire software development life cycle, end to end.
- Contributions make you get paid, not the experiences.

## Job and the challenges

- Your HTML/CSS have to be good enough to create world class UI (Hint: we don't use `float`).
- Knowledge of techniques like BEM, CSS modules, inline styles, .etc and why they exist is a good sign.
- Implement mobile-first, responsive UI and a good sense of design.
- Enough knowledge to realise that Javascript world is a mess right now.
- Fluent in Javascript and the language's common pitfalls/patterns.
- Angular or React or Vue: you don't have to know all of them, component-based architecture is what you must know to get things done in the right way.
- Performance?

## How to be a dwarf?

We build innovative apps for startup. You have to prove that you own the platform or can/want to own the platform one day. You've built several applications and our initial assignments during the [interview process](https://github.com/dwarvesf/WeAreHiring#hiring-process) will be a walk in a park for you ;-)

Hopefully you'll have some published code (maybe on GitHub?) that we can take a look at.

Honestly, we don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, and so on. We want to see that you know the shit.
