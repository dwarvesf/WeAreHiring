WE ARE LOOKING FOR A FRONTEND ENGINEER TO JOIN OUR TEAM IN SAIGON. Join a team of developers and designers dedicated to creating products people love to use

## About us

Found in 2014, Dwarves Foundation is an innovation service firm. [We stand for the craftsmanship](../additional-info/what-we-stand-for.md) in software development. Our woodland is a sum of great technology, engineering culture, and smart people. The numbers speak for themselves:

- 5 years in the market
- 40 talented members
- 10 common team size per deployments
- 3 Vietnam Development Communities Influenced

## Requirements

- A Linux or Mac user
- Passionate about coding and programming, innovation, and solving challenging problems
- Strong knowledge in JavaScript fundamentals
- Well versed in various browser technologies
- Your HTML/CSS have to be good enough to create world-class UI (hint: we don't use float)
- Knowledge of techniques like BEM, CSS modules, inline styles, .etc and why they exist is a good sign
- Enough knowledge to realize that Javascript world is a mess right now
- Fluent in Javascript and the language's common pitfalls/patterns
- Angular or React or Vue: you don't have to know all of them, component-based architecture is what you must know to get things done in the right way

## Job and the challenges

- Implement mobile-first, responsive UI and a good sense of design
- Collaborate with Backend Engineers to build features and ship experiments
- Build efficient and reusable front-end systems and abstractions
- Participate in design and code reviews
- Collaborate with Experience Designers to iterate on the design and implementation of our product

## Benefits & perks

### Healthcare

We provide comprehensive medical and life insurance for our fulltime members. We want to make sure that you don't have to worry about your life and contributing to things that matter.

### Stay fresh

Work is a marathon, not a sprint. We work a sustainable pace of 40 hours a week, with the occasional emergency or once-every-few-years special push demanding more.

### No office traps

We don't offer things like Foosball tables, catered meals in the office, and other “perks” designed to keep you at work for all of your waking hours. We were hoping you could put in 8 quality hours then go live your life, rest, and recharge so you can come back fresh to do it again.

### Employee stock option plan

If you don’t want to be just tenured employees, you can own the company. As part of the package, being the significant contributors will give you the right to buy a certain amount of company shares at a predetermined price. We will discuss on a case-by-case basis.

### Flexible working hours

We care about the quality of the work we produce rather than the number of hours worked. We do not have a specific start time. Likewise, there isn’t a time we expect everyone to leave the office. However we do have several meetings among the company, so you should get into the office or dial in before that time. We need to respect the team and our commitments so if we have a meeting booked for a certain time you are expected to be accommodating.

### Paid time off

Dwarves Foundation offers two weeks of paid vacation, a few extra personal days to use at your discretion, and the official national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so if you need a couple of extra days, no problem. We don’t track your days off; we use the honor system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking an extended absence, so they’re not left in the lurch.
