## Office

We keep the office warm and cozy for the team. It's better to stay small and healthy.

## Home office

If you prefer working from home due to whatever reason, you can choose a few days in a month.

But honestly, we have a beautiful office, it's a lot of fun here, we've got huge screens in front of us, high-speed internet, ergonomic bean bag chair ... Why would you stay alone at home?

We only require you to be online on Slack so that we can contact you if things go wrong and also commit the code regularly so that we see things are going well.

Results are what matters here, not sitting in the office 9-5.

## AirBnB

We use the other parts of the house to host AirBnb guests. It's a great opportunity for us to know more friends from around the world, do culture exchange and have more fun.
