My journey with Dwarves began with a glance at their logo during my senior year at Bach Khoa University. While browsing through tech job listings on the university's website, Dwarves' distinctive red logo caught my eye amidst a sea of white logo backgrounds. I read the JD, found it aligned with my aspirations, aced the test, sailed through interviews, and here I am.

Though I've only been with Dwarves for just over a year, my job satisfaction is a solid 10/10. Thanks to remote work, I save 2-3 hours on commuting, granting me more time for fitness, knowledge updates, and quality moments with my parents.

In my year with Dwarves, I've worked on two projects: Console Labs and another client project. Starting at Console, I received big support from **Khoi** and **Tuan Dao**. Even with seemingly simple questions, they patiently explained and provided me with reading materials. I did appreciate it.

And the most memorable experience was tackling the client project, where the difficulty level soared, delving into domains I hadn't touched before. For two weeks in a row, I worked tirelessly until 11PM to complete difficult tasks. As a newcomer, I hesitated to seek guidance initially, only turning to **Bien Vo** for the toughest queries. Then **Thanh Pham** caught up and assigned **Hieu Phan** as my mentor. Lucky me!

Despite the steep learning curve, I realized a crucial lesson: when in doubt, reach out to Dwarves Team for support; their unwavering support propels both personal and professional growth.
