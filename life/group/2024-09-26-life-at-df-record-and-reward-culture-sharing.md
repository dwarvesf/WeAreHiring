Life at Dwarves | Learning and knowledge sharing culture

At Dwarves, we believe learning is the key to success. We're not just talking about it; we're actively building a culture where sharing knowledge is valued and rewarded.

By participating in our learning activities, you not only grow but also get recognized for your contributions. We've set aside a monthly pool of 2500 ICY (around $4000) to reward those who actively share their knowledge. 70% of this pool goes to contributors who bring valuable insights to the community, especially in our focus areas: AI/LLM, Golang, Software Architecture, and Blockchain.

You can check out how ICY is distributed in the ðŸ§Šãƒ»earn-icy channel.

- Contribute to open source: We love building tools that boost productivity. If you're into that, hop into ðŸ¦„ãƒ»build and start creating something awesome.
  We hope to create a welcoming community for everyone who joins in.
