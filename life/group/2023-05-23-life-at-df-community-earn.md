### Life at Dwarves: Community Earn

### Go the extra mile

---

2023 sounds like a good time to expand more on the Dwarves Discord community. We would like to introduce to you our next initiative - Dwarves Community Earn.

While this is how we recognize mastery and move forward and transition into 50% community 50% company to bring tech enthusiasts together.

### How to participate?

---

Despite the background, if you have a passion for tech and the urge to improve, we provide all things that are needed. All the techniques we applied, all the new technologies we learned at Dwarves Foundation helped to save time and make automation easier.

We do this so to encourage everyone to learn new things, do new things, create new things and/or engage with the rest of the team. Our quests are officially public, and there‚Äôs ICY to be earned for all the quests.

We encourage our engineers to create a post of any interesting tech that they believe might bring value to the company.

### Our team members have good things to say

---

We do have an open task for collecting engagement metrics on discord, which will be part of a series of enhancements we plan to do for our internal tool, Fortress. This will be considered as paid work and you will be rewarded an appropriate bounty in the end.

Tooling - Engagement

The dwarvesf/tooling is a specific tooling set for us to have a same development environment
