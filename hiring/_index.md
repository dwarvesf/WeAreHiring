## Despite the level, we seek people that make things work
As a profitable and fast-moving company, the opportunities ahead of us are limitless. We are looking for people to grow with us and achieve great things together.

We want people who get things done, work fast, and ship fast. People who feel thrilled about new ideas, new technology, or complex problems, then figure their ways out to deliver results.

We want people who are passionate about software, talented at what they do, and [respect craftsmanship](https://memo.d.foundation/careers/additional-info/the-manifesto/). People who understand precisely what goes into their codes, and have no problem explaining it.

We want people who are calm, kind, and responsible. People who take the reign, run the show instead of waiting to be told what to do.
